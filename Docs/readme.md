# Building the API Documentation Site
---
* Make sure that you have [docfx](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx) installed and added to the system's PATH environment variable.
* Open the command prompt inside the `docfx_project` folder.
* Run the following command: `docfx ./docfx.json`
* The compiled output will be deposited into the `docfx_project/_site` folder, whose content you can then serve either on- or offline for the consumers of this API to navigate. Official docs are available in their separate, specific [repository](https://github.com/GlitchedPolygons/GlitchedEpistle.Client.Docs).
